=== UML Notation

The POI Conceptual Model (CM) Standard is presented in this document through diagrams using the <<omguml,Unified Modeling Language>> (UML) static structure diagram. The UML notations used in this standard are described in the diagram in <<figure-1>>.

All associations between model elements in the POI Conceptual Model are uni-directional. Thus, associations in the model are navigable in only one direction. The direction of navigation is depicted by an arrowhead. In general, the context an element takes within the association is indicated by its role. The role is displayed near the target of the association. If the graphical representation is ambiguous though, the position of the role has to be drawn to the element the association points to.

The following stereotypes are used in this model:

* &#171;__Abstract__&#187; TBD
* &#171;__DataType__&#187; defines a set of properties that lack identity. A data type is a classifier with no operations, whose primary purpose is to hold information.
* &#171;__FeatureType__&#187; represents features that are similar and exhibit common characteristics. Features are abstractions of real-world phenomena and have an identity.
* &#171;__Metaclass__&#187; (Optional) a profile class and packageable element which may be extended through one or more stereotypes, which defines how an existing metaclass may be extended as part of a profile. 
* &#171;__Property__&#187; denotes attributes and association roles. This stereotype does not add further semantics to the conceptual model but is required to be able to add tagged values to the attributes and association roles that are relevant for the encoding.
* &#171;__Type__&#187; denotes classes that are not directly instantiable, but are used as an abstract collection of operation, attribute and relation signatures. The stereotype is used in the POI Conceptual Model only for classes that are imported from the ISO standards 19103, 19107, 19109, and 19115.

To enhance the readability of the POI UML diagrams, classes are depicted in different colors. The following coloring scheme is applied:

Classes painted in green belong to the POI Requirements Class.

Classes painted in yellow are defined in the ISO standards 19107, 19109, or 19115. Their class names are preceded by the UML package name, in which the classes are defined.

The color white is used for notes and <<ISO19507,Object Constraint Language>> (OCL) constraints that are provided in the UML diagrams.

The example UML diagram in <<figure-2>> demonstrates the UML notation and coloring scheme used throughout this standard. In this example, the yellow classes are associated with the _ISO Standards_, the green classes are from the _POI Example Classes_, and the white classes depicts notes.
