== Terms and Definitions

This document uses the terms defined in Sub-clause 5.3 of <<OGC06-121r9>>, which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word "`shall`" (not "`must`") is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard.

This document also uses terms defined in the OGC Standard for Modular specifications (<<modspec,OGC 08-131r3>>), also known as the 'ModSpec'. The definitions of terms such as standard, specification, requirement, and conformance test are provided in the ModSpec.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

[[application-schema-definition]] 
=== application schema:: 

_conceptual schema_ (<<conceptual-schema-definition>>) for data required by one or more applications. 

NOTE: An _application schema_ (<<application-schema-definition>>) contains selected parts of the base schemas presented in the ORM Information Viewpoint.

NOTE: Designers of _application schemas_ (<<application-schema-definition>>) may extend or restrict the types defined in the base schemas to define appropriate types for an application _domain_ (<<domain-definition>>). 

NOTE: _Application schemas_ (<<application-schema-definition>>) are information models for a specific information community.

[[feature-definition]]
=== feature::

abstraction of real-world phenomena

NOTE: A _feature_ (<<feature-definition>>) may occur as a type or an instance. In this document, _feature_ (<<feature-definition>>) instance is meant unless otherwise specified.

[.source]
<<ISO19101-1,clause 4.1.11>>, Note 1 to entry has been added from ISO 19156, 4.6

[[feature-type-definition]]
=== feature type::

_class_ (<<class-definition>>) of _features_ (<<feature-definition>>) having common characteristics

[.source]
<<ISO19156,clause 4.7>>

[[geometric-aggregate-definition]]
=== geometric aggregate::

collection of _geometric objects_ (<<geometric-object-definition>>) that has no internal structure

NOTE: No assumptions about the spatial relationships between the elements can be made.

[.source]
<<ISO19107,clause 3.45>>

[[geometric-boundary-definition]]
=== geometric boundary::

boundary represented by a set of _geometric primitives_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) that limits the extent of a _geometric object_ (<<geometric-object-definition>>)

[.source]
<<ISO19107,clause 3.46>>

[[geometric-complex-definition]]
=== geometric complex::

set of disjoint _geometric primitives_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) where the boundary of each _geometric primitive_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) can be represented as the union of other _geometric primitives_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) of smaller dimensions within the same set

NOTE: The _geometric primitives_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) in the set are disjoint in the sense that no _direct position_ (<<direct-position-definition>>) is interior to more than one _geometric primitive_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>). The set is closed under boundary _operations_ (<<operation-definition>>), meaning that for each element in the _geometric complex_ (<<geometric-complex-definition>>), there is a collection (also a _geometric complex_ (<<geometric-complex-definition>>)) of _geometric primitives_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) that represents the boundary of that element. Recall that the boundary of a _point_ (the only 0D primitive _object_ (<<object-definition>>) type in geometry) is empty. Thus, if the largest dimension _geometric primitive_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) is a solid (3D), the composition of the boundary operator in this definition terminates after at most three steps. It is also the case that the boundary of any _object_ (<<object-definition>>) is a cycle.

[.source]
<<ISO19107,clause 3.47>>

[[geometric-dimension-definition]]
=== geometric dimension::

lagest number n such that each _point_ in a set of _points_ can be associated with a subset that has that point in its interior and is topologically isomporphic to ùîºn, Euclidean n-space

[.source]
<<ISO19107,clause 3.48>>

[[geometric-object-definition]]
=== geometric object::

spatial _object_ (<<object-definition>>) representing a _geometric set_ (<<geometric-set-definition>>)

NOTE: A _geometric object_ (<<geometric-object-definition>>) consists of a _geometric primitive_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>), a collection of _geometric primitives_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>), or a _geometric complex_ (<<geometric-complex-definition>>) treated as a single entity. A _geometric object_ (<<geometric-object-definition>>) may be the spatial representation of an _object_ (<<object-definition>>) such as a _feature_ (<<feature-definition>>) or a significant part of a _feature_ (<<feature-definition>>).

[.source]
<<ISO19107,clause 3.49>>

[[geometric-primitive-definition]]
=== geometric primitive (geometry)::

_geometric object_ (<<geometric-object-definition>>) representing a single, connected, homogeneous (isotopic) element of space

NOTE: _Geometric primitives_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) are non-decomposed _objects_ (<<object-definition>>) that present information about geometric configuration. They include _points_, curves, surfaces, and solids. Many _geometric objects_ (<<geometric-object-definition>>) behave like primitives (supporting the same interfaces defined for geometric primitives) but are actually composites composed of some number of other primitives. General collections may be aggregates and incapable of acting like a primitive (such as the lines of a complex network, which is not connected and thus incapable of being traceable as a single line). By this definition, a _geometric primitive_ (<<geometric-primitive-definition>>) is topological open, since the boundary _points_ are not isotropic to the interior _points_. Geometry is assumed to be closed. For _points_, the boundary is empty.

[.source]
<<ISO19107,clause 3.50>>

[[geometric-set-definition]]
=== geometric set::

set of _points_ 

[.source]
<<ISO19107,clause 3.53>>

[.source]
<<ogcdr,OGC Definitions Register>>

[[location-definition]]
=== location::

particular _place_ (<<place-definition>>) or _position_ (<<position-definition>>)

NOTE: A _location_ (<<location-definition>>) identifies a geographic _place_.

NOTE: _Locations_ (<<location-definition>>) are physically fixed _points_, typically on the surface of the Earth, although _locations_ (<<location-definition>>) can be relative to other, non-earth centric coordinate reference systems. 

NOTE: _Locations_ (<<location-definition>>) can be a single _point_, a centroid, a minimum bounding rectangle, or a set of vectors. 

NOTE: A _location_ (<<location-definition>>) should be persistent over time and does not change. 

NOTE: Multiple _POIs_ (<<point-of-interest-definition>>) may share the same _location_ (<<location-definition>>). 

NOTE: When a _POI_ (<<point-of-interest-definition>>) physically moves it is understood to have acquired a new _location_ (<<location-definition>>).

[.source]
<<ISO19112,clause 3.1.3>>

[[metaclass-definition]]

[[object-definition]]
=== object::

entity with a well defined boundary and identity that encapsulates state and behaviour

NOTE: This term was first used in this way in the general theory of object oriented programming, and later adopted for use in this same sense in UML. An _object_ (<<object-definition>>) is an instance of a _class_ (<<class-definition>>). _Attributes_ (<<attribute-definition>>) and relationships represent state. _Operations_ (<<operation-definition>>), methods, and state machines represent behavior.

[.source]
<<OMG/UML UML Semantics, version 1.3, 1997.>>

[[OGC-implementation-specification-definition]]
=== OGC implementation specification::

_OGC implementation specification_ (<<OGC-implementation-specification-definition>>) document type defined on the OGC Document Types Register

//Should this be Open GIS?  On the definitions register:  A document containing a computing platform dependent specification for application program interfaces, protocols etc. OpenGIS Implementation Specifications (Clause 4.34) contain detailed software specifications for implementing standard interfaces, protocols etc. on particular distributed computing platforms such as the Web, SQL, OLE/COM and CORBA.//

[[operation-definition]]
=== operation::

specification of a transformation or query that an _object_ (<<object-definition>>) may be called to execute

NOTE: An _operation_ (<<operation-definition>>) has a name and a list of parameters.

NOTE: See <<ISO19119,clause 7.2>> for a discussion of _operation_ (<<operation-definition>>)

[.source]
<<ISO19119,clause 4.1.10>>

[[place-definition]]
=== place::

identifiable part of any space

[[platform-specific-model-definition]] 
=== Platform Specific Model:

a model of a system that is defined in terms of a specific _platform_ (<<platform-definition>>)

[.source]
<<mdaguide>>, 
#Object Management Group, Model Driven Architecture Guide rev. 2.0#

[[point-definition]]
=== point::

0-dimensional geometric primitive, representing a _position_ (<<position-definition>>)

[.source]
<<ISO19136-1,clause 3.1.47>>

[[point-of-interest-definition]]
=== point of interest::

alt:[POI]

_location_ (<<location-definition>>) where one can find a _place_, product or service

NOTE: A _POI_ (<<point-of-interest-definition>>) is typically identified by _name_ rather than by an _address_.

NOTE: A _POI_ (<<point-of-interest-definition>>) is characterized by _type_, which may be used as a reference _point_ or a target in a _location_ (<<location-definition>>) based service request.

NOTE: A _POI_ (<<point-of-interest-definition>>) does not exclude the labeling, identification, and tracking of persons and other physical _objects_ (<<object-definition>>) that have no permanent _location_ (<<location-definition>>).

[example]
destination of a route; such as, Boston

[[position-definition]]
=== position::

data type that describes a _point_ or _geometry_ potentially occupied by an _object_ (<<object-definition>>) or person

NOTE:  A _direct position_ (<<direct-position-definition>>) is a semantic subtype of _position_ (<<position-definition>>). _Direct positions_ (<<direct-position-definition>>) as described can only define a _point_, and therefore not all _positions_ (<<position-definition>>) can be represented by a _direct position_ (<<direct-position-definition>>). That is consistent with the is type of relation. An ISO 19107 geometry is also a _position_ (<<position-definition>>), but not a _direct position_ (<<direct-position-definition>>)

[.source]
<<ISO19133>>

[[property-definition]]
=== property::

facet or _attribute_ (<<attribute-definition>>) of an _object_ (<<object-definition>>) referenced by a name

[example]
Abby's car has the colour red, where "colour red" is a _property_ (<<property-definition>>) of the car.

[.source]
<<ISO19143,clause 4.21>>, Note 1 to entry has been added from ISO 19156, 4.15

[[requirements-class-definition]]
=== requirements class::

a class of requirements, comprising a logical grouping of normative statements that shall be satisfied as a group in conformant implementations. May have dependencies on other _requirements classes_ (<<requirements-class-definition>>) , but there should be no circular dependencies else the classes must always be satisfied together so are functionally one class.

[[standardization-target-definition]]
=== standardization target::

_standardization target_ (<<standardization-target-definition>>)

[.source]
<<ogcdr,OGC Definitions Register>>

[[stereotype-definition]]
=== stereotype::

extension of an existing _metaclass_ (<<metaclass-definition>>) that enables the use of _platform_ (<<platform-definition>>) or _domain_ (<<domain-definition>>) specific terminology or notation in place of, or in addition to, the ones used for the extended _metaclass_ (<<metaclass-definition>>)
